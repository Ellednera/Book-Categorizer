# Book-Categorizer
Categorize Books using Perceptrons. 

This is just for fun :)

All you need to do is to key in the characteristics of the book cover in the data file. Then train, validate and test :)

Currently available categories are "魅丽优品" and "意林"

The module AI::Perceptron::Simple is used for the programs. So you might need to download it from CPAN or you can look for it in my other repo named "AI-Perceptron-Simple"
