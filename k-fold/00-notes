k-fold

Dataset
  Total entries: 50, using 1st-129t records for the moment
  k = 5

File structure
/k-fold
  /tested_data
    *tested data written to new CSV files to generate confusion matrixes 
     and for inspection if necessary
  /confusion_matrixes
    *k number of confusion matrixes data file for calculating the mean
  00-data_50.csv (all 50 data)
  00-notes
  05-fold-1.csv, 02-fold-2.csv, ..., 02-fold-5.csv
  10-*.pl : all perl codes (creation, training, testing)
  15-*.nerve : all the different models
  20-c_matrix-* : all confusion matrix for each individual model to get mean

File naming conventions: 02-fold-n.csv, n = +ve integers, >0

Neurons: 
1. 3 neurons, with different learning rates, the rest constant
   - learning rate: 0.01, 0.5 2.5
   - plasticity: 0.8153
   - threshold: scalar @dendrites * 8

2. n neurons, dirrefent learning rates, plasticity, and threashold
   - yet to be known

Logic
for each nerve, train using k-fold
    for each iteration, train using 4 folds, test with 1
    test and store the 5 confusion matrixes into a single file
    compare nerves' performance ie calculate mean

testing & mean in a single script
comparing performance in another script
